# Manga Checklists Data

> This repository contains all the data from the app [Manga Checklists](https://github.com/alessandrojean/manga-checklists).

## How it works?

All the information are converted in JSON files, so the app can read the with facility, instead of parsing the HTML from the publishers website.

It's manual, so it's possible to insert all the releases from all the manga publishers, even those that doesn't publish an checklist, like [DarkSide Books](http://www.darksidebooks.com.br/), [Devir](http://devir.com.br/), [Nova Sampa](https://www.editoranovasampa.com.br/loja/) etc.

## How to obtain the information?

All the information about the mangas, and the checklists itself, are published in the website of the publishers. However, there is exceptions, like the mangas from Panini, that the information came from [Amazon](https://amazon.com.br), [Brazilian Agency of the ISBN](http://www.isbn.bn.br/website/consulta/cadastro), [Panini's Shop](https://loja.panini.com.br/panini/vitrines/default.aspx) and their page on Facebook, [Panini Mangas](https://pt-br.facebook.com/PaniniMangas/app/1706637092931001/?ref=page_internal).

In [this page](https://alessandrojean.github.io/manga-checklists-data/informacoes) you will find more information of each publisher.

## How to collaborate?

I created a simple Single Page Application to help you to create the missing mangas and checklists in the app. All the information **must** follow an pattern, specified [here](https://alessandrojean.github.io/manga-checklists-data/padroes).

The tool is available [here](https://alessandrojean.github.io/manga-checklists-data-manager).
